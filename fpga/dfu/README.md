# DFU bootloader for ULX3S

This bootloader makes passthru at US1 port for ESP32 flashing
and USB DFU at US2 port for FPGA flashing. DFU is very fast.
Source is based on [HAD2019 badge bootloader](https://github.com/smunaut/had2019-playground)
modified to [ULX3S bootloader](https://github.com/emard/had2019-playground)

To install new bootloader for the first time (5 minutes flashing)
choose bitstream for your board and:

    fujprog -j flash multiboot.img

or

    openFPGALoader -b ulx3s --unprotect-flash --file-type bin -f multiboot.img.gz

To enter bootloader, hold BTN1 and plug US2
In bootloader mode, LEDs 0-2 should be ON, other LEDs 3-7 OFF:

|   D7   |   D6   |   D5   |   D4   |   D3   |    D2   |    D1   |    D0   |
|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|---------|---------|---------|
|&#x2b1b;|&#x2b1b;|&#x2b1b;|&#x2b1b;|&#x2b1b;|&#x1f7e9;|&#x1f7e7;|&#x1f7e5;|

Depending on USB and RTC state (low power sleep),
board may not immediately power on when US2 is plugged.
If board doesn't power on from US2:

    Option 1: additionaly plug US1
    Option 2: hold BTN1 as "shift" key and shortly press BTN0 for board to power ON

DFU should enumerate on US2 port:

On linux, it's practical to add a udev rule which allows normal users
members of "dialout" group to also run dfu-util,
otherwise it should be run as root:

    # file: /etc/udev/rules.d/80-fpga-dfu.rules
    # this is for DFU 1d50:614b libusb access
    ATTRS{idVendor}=="1d50", ATTRS{idProduct}=="614b", \
    GROUP="dialout", MODE="666"

To upload user bitstream with openFPGALoader, plug to US2 and
hold BTN1 or set DIP SW1 ON.
Bitstream can be gzip-compressed to save storage on PC,
OpenFPGALoader will gunzip on-the-fly:

    openFPGALoader -b ulx3s_dfu bitstream.bit.gz

To upload and start user bitstream with "dfu-util" tool,
we can use this

    dfu-util -a 0 -D blink.bit
    dfu-util -a 0 -e

sometimes this one-liner will work too:

    dfu-util -a 0 -R -D blink.bit

To list all flashing destinations for -a N

    dfu-util -l

To upload DFU bootloader itself, hold BTN1 and BTN2, plug to US2:

    dfu-util -a 5 -D multiboot.bit
